# AI-Powered-Malaria-Diagnosis-Assistant-Using-Deep-Learning
Capstone project on malaria diagnosis using deep learning
# AI-Powered Malaria Diagnosis Assistant

## Project Overview
This project is part of my Artificial Intelligence training capstone. It focuses on using deep learning to classify malaria blood smear images as parasitized or uninfected.

## Objectives
- Develop a CNN-based model for malaria diagnosis
- Apply AI to healthcare and disease detection
- Improve diagnostic accuracy and speed

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow & Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Methodology
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained on malaria blood smear images. The dataset was preprocessed, split into training and testing sets, and evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Results
The model achieved high classification accuracy and demonstrated the potential of AI in supporting malaria diagnosis, especially in low-resource settings.
